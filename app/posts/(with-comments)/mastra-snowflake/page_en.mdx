As a commemoration of starting with Mastra, I created a data analysis AI agent using Mastra and Snowflake MCP Server.  
I will summarize how to create an AI agent using Mastra and how to use Snowflake data to create an AI agent.

### What is Mastra?

It is a framework for creating so-called AI agents.
Since it is developed by the Gatsby team members, there is a mysterious sense of security.
It has various functions such as Agentic Workflow, RAG, and agent evaluation functions.

### Implementing with Mastra x Next.js x Snowflake MCP Server

1. Create a Next.js project
`$ create-next-app@latest next-snowflake-mastra`

2. Install Mastra

``` bash
$ npm install -g mastra@latest 
$ mastra init
```
 
When you run `mastra init`, it proceeds in a wizard format, but be careful only about the following parts.

- Create the src/mastra directory and set the entry point
- Add necessary dependencies
- Set TypeScript compiler options

3. Implement the AI agent that calls the Snowflake MCP Server
Set the MCPConfiguration so that the Agent can use MCP

``` typescript
const mcp = new MCPConfiguration({
  id: "snowflake-agent-mcp",
  servers: {
    snowflake_pip: {
      command: "uv",
      args: [
        "--directory",
        "/Users/your_user_name/ghq/github.com/isaacwasserman/mcp-snowflake-server",
        "run",
        "mcp_snowflake_server",
        "--account",
        "ORG_NAME_ACCOUNT_NAME",
        "--warehouse",
        "YOUR_WH",
        "--user",
        "YOUR_USER_NAME",
        "--password",
        "YOUR_PASSWORD",
        "--role",
        "SYSADMIN",
        "--database",
        "YOUR_DATABASE",
        "--schema",
        "YOUR_SCHEMA",
      ]
    }
  },
});
```

Create two types of Agents.
- snowflakeQueryAgent: An agent that analyzes user questions and retrieves appropriate query results
- snowflakeAnalysisAgent: An agent that analyzes data and visualizes it as an expert in data analysis

`snowflakeQueryAgent` analyzes user questions and returns appropriate query results.  
It is good to write in detail about the databases, schemas, tables that can be analyzed, and what kind of data is in them so that it can query nicely.

`snowflakeAnalysisAgent` analyzes data and provides insights as an expert in data analysis and visualization. It uses tools to generate data for visualization and records insights.

```typescript
export const snowflakeQueryAgent = new Agent({
  name: "snowflakeQueryAgent",
  instructions: `  
        Analyze user questions and retrieve appropriate query results.

        Available databases: SUMO
        Available schemas: CHANCO
        
        Available tables:
        - BANZUKE: Information on sumo wrestler rankings
        
        【BANZUKE table】
        Information on sumo wrestler rankings (data from January 1983 to July 2024)
        
        - ID: Unique ID of the wrestler
        - RIKISHI: Wrestler's name
        - RANK: Initials of the ranking (class and position)
          * Y = Yokozuna (highest rank)
          * O = Ozeki
          * S = Sekiwake
          * K = Komusubi
          * M = Maegashira
          * J = Juryo
          * Sd = Makushita
          * Numbers indicate rank (e.g., Y1e = Yokozuna East 1st)
          * e = East, w = West
          * HD = Absence due to injury
          * YO = Warning from the Yokozuna Deliberation Council
        - HEYA: Stable name (sumo stable to which the wrestler belongs)
        - SHUSSHIN: Place of origin
        - BIRTH_DATE: Date of birth
        - HEIGHT: Height (cm)
        - WEIGHT: Weight (kg)
        - BASHO: Tournament (year and month format, e.g., 2023.01)
        - PREV: Previous tournament ranking
        - PREV_W: Number of wins in the previous tournament, note that if BASHO is January 2023, PREV_W is the number of wins in the November 2022 tournament
        - PREV_L: Number of losses in the previous tournament, note that if BASHO is January 2023, PREV_L is the number of losses in the November 2022 tournament
        
        Since date-type data cannot be converted to JSON format, when retrieving date-type data,
        use the TO_VARCHAR function to convert it to string type. Example:
        TO_VARCHAR(BIRTH_DATE, 'YYYY-MM-DD') as BIRTH_DATE
        When calculating the win rate, there may be cases where the number of matches is 0 due to the wrestler's absence,
        so use the CASE statement to ensure that the denominator does not become 0.
      `,
  model: openai("gpt-4o-mini"),
  tools: {
    ...(await mcp.getTools()),
  },
});

export const snowflakeAnalysisAgent = new Agent({
  name: "snowflakeAnalysisAgent",
  instructions: `
        You are an expert in data analysis and visualization.

        Analyze the given data and provide the following:
        2. Important insights obtained from the data (at least 3)
        3. Detailed explanation of the analysis results

        【About data format】
        The input data will be provided in one of the following formats:
        - Structured data in JSON format
        - Text data (e.g., list of sumo wrestler rankings)

        If you receive text data, first understand the content and structure it in a form that can be analyzed.
        For example, if a list of wrestlers is provided, you can analyze the win rate, the relationship between weight and win rate, the distribution of places of origin, etc.

        Be sure to use the following tools:
        - visualizeDataTool (for data visualization)
        - snowflake_pip_append_insight (for recording insights)
        
        【How to use visualizeDataTool】

        visualizeDataTool({
          data: [...], // Array of data to visualize (required)
          visualizationType: "bar", "line", "pie", "table"
          title: "Title", // Optional
          xAxis: "Column name for X-axis", // Optional
          yAxis: "Column name for Y-axis" // Optional
        })

        Choose the appropriate visualization type according to the characteristics of the data:
        - Comparative data → Bar chart (bar)
        - Time series data → Line chart (line)
        - Composition ratio → Pie chart (pie)

        【About insights】
        Use the snowflake_pip_append_insight tool to record important insights obtained from the data:

        snowflake_pip_append_insight({
          insight: "Description of the discovered insight"
        })

        Each insight should be specific and based on the data.
        Example: "The average win rate of Juryo wrestlers in 2023 is 58%, an increase of 5% from the previous year."

        【About analysis text】
        Finally, provide a detailed explanation of the overall analysis results.
        This text should include:
        - Overview of the data
        - Key trends and features
        - Detailed explanation of insights
        - Since images cannot be displayed, limit the explanation to text.
      `,
  model: openai("gpt-4o-mini"),
  tools: {
    ...snowflakeTools,
    ...(await mcp.getTools()),
  },
});
```

Next, write the process to call the Agent in Server Actions.

```typescript
"use server";

import { mastra } from "@/mastra";

export type MessageResponse = {
  text: string;
  data?: any;
  insights?: string[];
};

/**
 * Send a message to the Snowflake agent
 * @param message User's message
 * @returns Response from the agent
 */
export async function sendMessage(message: string): Promise<MessageResponse> {
  try {
    // Execute the workflow
    const snowflakeWorkflow = mastra.getWorkflow("snowflakeWorkflow");
    const { start } = snowflakeWorkflow.createRun();

    console.log("userQuery", message);

    // Start the workflow and execute all steps
    const result = await start({
      triggerData: { userQuery: message },
    });

    const queryResult = workflowResult.results?.queryData?.output?.queryResult;
    const analysisResult = workflowResult.results?.analyzeData?.output;

    // If there is a query result but no analysis result
    if (queryResult && (!analysisResult || !analysisResult.analysisText)) {
      return {
        text: queryResult,
        data: null,
        insights: []
      };
    }
    
    // If there is an analysis result
    if (analysisResult) {
      return {
        text: analysisResult.analysisText || "Analysis completed.",
        data: analysisResult.visualizationData,
        insights: analysisResult.insights || []
      };
    }
    
    // If neither is available
    return {
      text: "An error occurred while retrieving the data.",
      data: null,
      insights: []
    };
  } catch (error) {
    console.error("Agent call error:", error);
    throw new Error("An error occurred while communicating with the agent");
  }
}
```

Finally, create a form in the React Component to input the content to be analyzed and execute the analysis.

4. Let's see

5. What kind of use cases are there?
This time, I created an agent that generates analysis insights and graphs immediately when you input the content you want to analyze, but I thought that other agents could be created as well.

- Data Cleaning Agent: An agent that detects and cleans missing or abnormal values in the data
- Reverse ETL Agent: An agent that analyzes data and returns it to the data source
- Semantic Layer Generation Agent: An agent that analyzes data and generates a semantic layer
